# NTU X Base Hackathon 2025
## Problem Statement
Generative AI has immense potential to solve creative problems, yet many consumers struggle to access high-quality AI experiences outside of centralized, paywalled
platforms. Build a web-based application that solves a real consumer problem by integrating the Sogni SDK. Your app should use Sogni's decentralized AI art infrastructure to generate high quality, creative outputs.
